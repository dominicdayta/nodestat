# The Dataframe Module

The `Dataframe` module contains methods for creating and managing dataframes. The goal of the module is to provide a split-apply-combine strategy for data analysis, and for this the module provides a number of functions that cover a wide range of operations, from slicing, subsetting, and appending dataframes, to making complex operations across the data in a dataframe.

The rest of the documentation is split across the following topics:

- [Creating Dataframes](creating.md)
- [Basic Methods](basic.md)
- [Slicing and Subsetting](slicing.md)
- [Combining](combining.md)
- [The Apply Functions](apply.md)
