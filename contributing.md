# How to contribute

At the moment this project is nothing more than a little hypothesis of mine that the Javascript language can be further empowered into a data analysis language the same way Python emerged into the Data Science scene through the arrival of the `pandas` and `numpy` packages, among others. In order to do this, I have set towards the goal of creating a unified grammar for data wrangling, one that plays well with packages for statistical computation.

As the project is still in its infancy, we would greatly appreciate the help from fellow developers in turning this silly package into a mature API for data science with Javascript. Below are some ways that you can help us out in this cause.

## Issues Reporting

We are tracking issues and unexpected behavior through Github. Some reminders:

1. If you are reporting a bug, please detail to the best that you can the exact circumstances that led to it. This way we can reproduce the bug and find the culprit in the source code. Also, we would appreciate it if you provided some information about what outcome you were expecting, besides the bug itself.

2. If you are proposing a change in the current implementation, please provide some examples as to how you envision the improved code can be. The same applies if you are proposing an additional feature. We will do our best to welcome any and all changes, given that they align with the design principles outlined in our [readme](readme.md).

## Expanding the Modules

Currently there are two modules within the Nodestat package: `Stats` and `Dataframe`. If you wish to extend either of them, please make a pull request and apply all changes to a new branch. Currently there is no standardized nomenclature for branches, but please make the name as explicit as possible (we recommend naming the branch to something that captures the theme of the changes you are trying to push into the main code).
