# The Stats Module

The `Stats` module extends the capability of `Dataframes` by implementing methods for performing data analysis and a number of basic statistical tests. This module is closely patterned after the `MASS` package written for the R language.

The rest of the documentation is split across the following topics:

- Statistics
- Summarizing Data
- Statistical Tests
